<h1>Spanish</h1>
<P> 
    <strong> The introduction of Spanish in the 15th century by invading Spaniards, the language has become the most dominant in the country. Over 95% of the population in Puerto Rico speaks the language in education, business, and daily life contexts. Spanish is also Puerto Rico's official language. Puerto Rico has developed a different version of the language. Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico borrowed from elements of African dialects, taino words, and English phrases. The difference with other Spanish dialects is not very pronounced, however, and Puerto Ricans understand other Spanish speakers from other countries.</strong>
    </P>
    <h1>English</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>
    English is another of the official languages, although it falls short on popularity. Less than 10% of Puerto Ricans speak the language. English was introduced after the US seized Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898. The US government instituted both English and Spanish as official languages of the US administration. Institution of English as the language of instruction in schools was challenged in 1930 by ethnic forces. Spanish was subsequently made the language of instruction while English was made the second language. Puerto Ricans are renowned for curating "Spanglish" which is a mixture of Spanish and English. The language is spoken mostly in or near tourism centers. </strong> </P>
